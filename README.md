# TeamBalanceH2
GSC Script fixed H2 team balance

Changed team balancing logic.

Will balance the player with the lowest score.


# How to implement.

Copy the file ""changeteamFixH2.gsc" into "user_scripts\mp" of your COD MWR folder.

Set in your server configuration file, ```set scr_teambalance "1"``` 

You need to restart the server if you did it from the cfg file. Or if you don't want to restart, you need to paste in the console. But you should include this in your cfg file.
